# Refactoring Plan: `rulebook-ai` Core and CLI

**Objective:** This document outlines the plan for a purely internal refactoring of the `rulebook-ai` codebase. The goal is to improve maintainability and extensibility without changing any user-facing behavior of the CLI.

## High-Level Goal

The current implementation in `core.py` is monolithic. The logic for handling different AI assistants is tightly coupled with the core file-management operations, making the system difficult to extend and maintain.

This refactoring will implement a clean **separation of concerns** by splitting the logic into two distinct parts:
1.  **A declarative configuration (`assistants.py`)**: This new file will define the *specification* for each assistant—what they expect to find on the filesystem—using a pure, data-only `AssistantSpec` class.
2.  **A generic engine (`core.py`)**: The `RuleManager` will be refactored into a generic engine that reads the assistant specifications and performs the necessary file operations. It will contain all the logic for how to generate rules.

This change will make adding a new assistant a simple matter of adding a new entry to the configuration file, without touching the core engine logic.

## Detailed Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Separate Specification from Logic (Completed)

1.  **Create `src/rulebook_ai/assistants.py` (New File):**
    *   This file will contain the declarative specifications for all supported assistants and will have no logic.
    *   Define a new `AssistantSpec` `dataclass` based on a first-principles analysis of assistant rule systems. Key attributes will include:
        *   `name`, `display_name`
        *   `is_single_file` (boolean)
        *   `rule_path` (the directory where rules are stored)
        *   `filename` (for single-file assistants)
        *   `file_extension` (for multi-file assistants)
        *   `supports_subdirectories` (boolean)
    *   Create the `SUPPORTED_ASSISTANTS` list in this file, populated with an `AssistantSpec` instance for each AI tool.

2.  **Refactor `src/rulebook_ai/core.py` into a Generic Engine:**
    *   Remove all assistant-specific constants and logic from `core.py`.
    *   Import the `SUPPORTED_ASSISTANTS` configuration from the new `assistants.py`.
    *   Refactor `RuleManager` to be a generic interpreter of the `AssistantSpec`.
    *   The logic for *how* to generate rules (e.g., "flatten and number files" vs. "preserve hierarchy") will reside entirely within private methods in `RuleManager`.
    *   **Refine public method orchestration:** The public methods will be refactored for clarity and compliance with the original design spec.
        *   `install()` will only handle copying files and will conclude by calling `self.sync()` to perform the rule generation.
        *   `sync()` will be the single entry point for all rule generation, always reading from the local `project_rules/` directory.
        *   `clean_rules()` and `clean_all()` will be made data-driven by iterating over `SUPPORTED_ASSISTANTS` and using the `clean_path` from the spec.

### Phase 2: Simplify and Automate `src/rulebook_ai/cli.py`

1.  **Implement Dynamic, Multi-Select CLI Arguments:**
    *   The `cli.py` module will import `SUPPORTED_ASSISTANTS` from `assistants.py`.
    *   The hardcoded, mutually exclusive CLI flags will be replaced. A loop will dynamically generate flags for each assistant (e.g., `--cursor`, `--cline`).
    *   These flags will use `action='append_const'` to allow users to select multiple assistants at once (e.g., `rulebook-ai install --cursor --copilot`).
    *   The `--all` flag will be a simple shortcut that populates the list with all assistants.
    *   The confusing `--no-copilot` flag will be removed entirely.

2.  **Decouple and Simplify Handlers:**
    *   The `handle_install` and `handle_sync` functions will be simplified to single lines.
    *   They will pass the `assistants` list, generated directly by `argparse`, to the corresponding `RuleManager` method.
    *   If no assistant flags are provided by the user, the list will be `None`, and the `RuleManager` will correctly interpret this as a request to install/sync for all assistants (the default behavior).

### Enhancement: Additional Assistant Support (Completed)

Following the refactor, the specification was extended to include Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI assistants with their own rule file paths and generalized cleanup of assistant artifacts. These additions build on the refactoring work without belonging to Phases 1–2.

An additional enhancement introduced a `bug-report` CLI command that links users to the project's issue tracker for submitting problems.

Another enhancement added a `rate-ruleset` CLI command that opens the Ratings & Reviews wiki, encouraging community feedback on rule sets.

An additional improvement surfaces the Ratings & Reviews wiki link within the `list-rules` command so users can read feedback before installing a ruleset.

A subsequent enhancement introduced support for mode-based assistants (Kilo Code, Roo Code), which required adding a `has_modes` flag to the `AssistantSpec` and extending the `RuleManager` engine. This demonstrated the extensibility of the refactored architecture.
