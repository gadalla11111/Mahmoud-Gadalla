# Knowledge Audit — DATE

## Instructions

Review the tables below. Edit the **Action** column to approve, change, or override each recommendation. Then run `/engram:consolidate execute` to apply.

**Action codes:** `DELETE`, `ARCHIVE`, `DOCS`, `MEMORY`, `RULES`, `CLAUDEMD`, `SKILL`, `MOVE`, `KEEP`, `SKIP`

Rows with `KEEP` or `SKIP` are no-ops during execution. `CLAUDEMD` rows will present a diff for explicit approval before any change.

## Filesystem audit
