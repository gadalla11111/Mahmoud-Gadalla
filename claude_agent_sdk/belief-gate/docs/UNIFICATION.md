# The Coherence Arrow: a unifying principle for trustworthy LLM systems

**Status:** Study / synthesis. This document connects three independently-developed
ideas — the belief-gate (this repo, measured), deterministic n-gram extraction
(Granville's Alt-DNN / RBF, external), and modality-preserving agent memory
(the "missing arrow" critique of AI-memory tools, external) — into a single
principle. The belief-gate parts are empirical; the cross-domain claims are
argued, and the central hypothesis is explicitly flagged as untested.

---

## 1. The one claim

> **A derived view — an answer, an extraction, a memory — is trustworthy only if it
> carries an arrow back to the source that produced it. Most LLM systems break
> precisely because the LLM, while compressing / judging / extracting, erases the
> arrow.**

This is cache coherence (distributed-systems literature, ~40 years old) applied to
cognition. A cache entry derived from a source of truth can only be trusted if there
is an *invalidation arrow* back to that source. An LLM that compresses "we *could*
refresh the TTL" into the flat fact "TTL refreshed" has produced a cache entry whose
arrow is gone: the recall path cannot tell a hedge from a decision, and the agent
acts on a fabrication. The same erasure happens when an LLM judges "the context
looks complete" (it cannot point to which required item is missing) or extracts a
value by loose regex (it cannot say which source token it came from, or with what
confidence).

The fix, in every case, is the same shape: **stop asking the LLM to compress or
judge the critical property; force a structured declaration whose arrow to the
source is preserved and checkable.**

---

## 2. Three instances of the same operation

| Instance | Critical property | What the LLM does wrong | The structural anchor (the arrow) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **belief-gate** (measured) | "Do I have the complete information the task needs?" | Judges completeness in-head; false-passes 7/15 on subtle gaps, model-dependent | `required − present` set difference / deletion-proof invariant. The arrow is `missing=[210]`: this answer depends on item 210, absent from the source. |
| **Deterministic extraction** (Alt-DNN, Lesson A) | "Is this datum present in the surface text?" | LLM-written regex is brittle; loose matching across noisy layouts | Stemmed multi-tokens + nested hashes; each match carries `f(x)` + a relevance grade — the arrow is "this came from this corpus token, this confidence." |
| **Coherent memory** (the missing arrow) | "Is this remembered fact a decision, an option, or a hypothesis?" | Lossy compression collapses modal status: "could" → "did" | A modality tag + provenance back-pointer + supersedes + TTL + invalidation hook + surfaced confidence. The arrow is literal: every fact points back to its source and can be invalidated. |

All three are the same move: **replace compression/judgment of a critical property
with a structured, source-anchored declaration that a deterministic checker can
verify.** This is the project's running thesis ("move determinism out of the LLM,
one step at a time") recognized in three independent domains.

## 3. The three layers form one pipeline

Stacked, the three are not competing ideas — they are three layers of one
trustworthy cognitive pipeline, each covering what the others do not:

```
   SOURCE  (database, document, API, prior turns)
        │
        ▼
   [1] EXTRACTION        ← deterministic multi-token / hash (Alt-DNN, Lesson A)
        │                  "what is actually present, robust to surface noise"
        ▼
   [2] VERIFICATION      ← belief-gate: set difference / coverage proof
        │                  "do I have everything the task requires? (never false-completes)"
        ▼
   [3] MEMORY            ← modality + provenance + invalidation (the missing arrow)
        │                  "what did I learn, and can the recall path trust it?"
        ▼
   ACTION
```

The empirical punchline that links them: **the three real benchmarks where the
belief-gate only tied or placed mid-pack did not fail at layer [2].** They failed at
layer [1] — the LLM-regex extractor produced an empty or mismatched `present` set
(long near-identical financial headers; an unparsed list). The belief-gate core was
flawless throughout (15/15 unit tests, leak-proof). **Layer [1] is the measured
bottleneck, and deterministic extraction is exactly its fix.** Layer [3] is the
layer we have not built at all.

So the two "distractions" are not distractions; they are the missing layers of the
same system, identified from outside and arriving exactly where the data said the
gaps were.

---

## 4. The coherence arrow, read backward into the gate

The memory critique supplies the unifying vocabulary, and it applies retroactively:

- **belief-gate already has the arrow.** `missing=[210]` *is* an arrow back to the
  source: "this answer is derived from item 210, which the source does not contain."
  The guarantee "never false-completes" *is* cache coherence: COMPLETE is certified
  only when the derivation (the answer) traces fully back to the source (every
  required item present). INCOMPLETE/UNDECIDABLE are honest invalidations.
- **belief-gate already has one of the six memory fields.** The
  COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / UNDECIDABLE verdict is a *modality tag* — it refuses to
  collapse "proven" with "don't know," which is exactly the "could vs did" the memory
  tools lose. The other five (provenance, supersedes, TTL, invalidation hook,
  surfaced confidence) are what extend the same discipline to persistent memory.

This is why the unification is not forced: the gate is already a coherence mechanism
for the *answer* derivation. Generalizing it means installing the same arrow at the
extraction layer (below) and the memory layer (above).

---

## 5. The central hypothesis (untested — the thing to resolve before building)

There is a real tension that decides whether the unification is sound or hand-wavy:

> **The gate's guarantee is HARD; memory's looks SOFT.** Set difference is a
> mathematical proof — the gate cannot false-complete. But preserving "could vs did"
> seems to depend on *reading modality correctly from text*, which is judgment again
> — the very thing we are trying to remove.

**Hypothesis: it is the same problem as layer [1], and has the same solution.**

You do not ask the LLM to "compress what matters" (which erases modality). You force
a structured emission where modality is a *required field*, not prose — exactly as
the belief-gate forces `required = set(...)` instead of "judge completeness," and
exactly as deterministic extraction forces a normalized token instead of free regex.
The LLM still reads the text, but it must commit modality into a slot the schema
defines; the checker then enforces coherence rules over that slot (a fact tagged
`option` may never be acted on as `decision`; a `supersedes` edge invalidates the
older row deterministically). The reading is still imperfect — but it is *checkable
and bounded*, the same way a declared coverage claim is checkable even when the LLM
mis-declares (and the repair loop recovers it).

If this hypothesis holds, the three layers collapse to a single principle:

> **Replace compression and judgment with structured declaration plus deterministic
> checking. The LLM may populate the structure imperfectly; the structure, and the
> checker over it, carry the coherence arrow the LLM would otherwise erase.**

If it fails — if modality genuinely cannot be bounded into a checkable slot — then
layer [3] is a different, harder problem, and the unification stops at layers [1]+[2].
Resolving this is the next study, before any memory code.

## 6. What each layer would need to be built

Concrete, in priority order by risk-adjusted value:

### Layer [1] — deterministic extraction (lowest risk, immediate payoff)
- Replace the LLM-regex `present`-extractor with normalized multi-token matching:
  stem + lowercase + collapse punctuation, then exact-match required keys against a
  hash of context tokens. No model in the decision path.
- Re-run the keyed-aggregation benchmark with this extractor. Prediction: the 7
  over-abstain (empty `present`) and 2 false-sufficient (header mismatch) largely
  vanish, turning the mid-pack tie into an *honest* win — honest because it comes
  from fixing the correct layer, not from cherry-picking the regime.
- This also discharges the lib README's load-bearing rule with a reference
  implementation: "feed `present` from a deterministic source."

### Layer [2] — verification (done; the stable center)
- belief-gate as it stands: `check_set`, `verify_coverage`, the repair loop, the
  three-verdict modality. 15/15 tests, leak-proof, cross-model 0/15. Nothing to add
  for the core; it is the fixed point the other layers attach to.

### Layer [3] — coherent memory (highest novelty, highest risk)
- A memory schema with the six fields from the critique: `modality`
  (decision/option/hypothesis), `provenance` (source back-pointer), `supersedes`,
  `ttl_class`, `invalidation_hook`, `confidence`.
- A deterministic recall path that refuses to surface an `option` as a `decision`,
  honors `supersedes` as invalidation, and expires by `ttl_class`.
- The LLM populates modality as a constrained field, not prose — testing the §5
  hypothesis directly.
- A benchmark mirroring the memory critique's test: store a hedge and a decision in
  the same session; measure whether the recall path keeps them distinct (the tool it
  tested inverted one of four). This is the layer [3] analogue of the gate's
  false-pass metric.

---

## 7. What this is, honestly

- **Proven:** layer [2] (the gate), and that the real-benchmark gaps were at layer
  [1] not [2]. The arrow framing of the gate's existing guarantee is a re-description
  of measured behavior, not a new claim.
- **Argued:** that extraction, verification, and memory are the same operation; that
  the coherence arrow unifies them; that the gate already implements it for answers.
- **Conjectured (flagged):** that modality in memory reduces to deterministic
  structured extraction (§5). This is the load-bearing untested claim. If true, the
  three layers are one principle; if false, memory is a separate problem and the
  unification covers [1]+[2] only.

The honest contribution, if the hypothesis survives a memory experiment, is not
"belief-gate reduces confabulation." It is: **trustworthy LLM cognition is cache
coherence — every derived view needs an arrow to its source — and that arrow is
installed by replacing LLM compression/judgment with structured declaration plus a
deterministic checker, at every layer from extraction through memory.**

## 8. Notes on the Alt-DNN source (scope of what was borrowed)

Only Lesson A (deterministic multi-token extraction) is taken, and only the classical
IR core of it (stemmed n-grams + nested hashes), which is sound and directly fixes
the measured layer-[1] bottleneck. The paper's RBF/Gaussian-mixture machinery,
training-free interpolation, and "96% vs 30–55%" comparison are **not** adopted: the
accuracy claim compares a corpus-specialized SLM to generic LLMs (apples/oranges),
and the rest is unverified here. Three of the four "lessons" a prior analysis drew
from it are rejected on principle:
- **Kernel relevance grades replacing PASS/FAIL** would reintroduce probabilistic
  judgment into the *decision* and break the never-false-complete guarantee. Fuzzy
  matching belongs in extraction (resolving "Store_A" vs "Loja A" *before* the set is
  formed), never in the completeness verdict.
- **Weighted θ-matrix predicates** make the coverage proof *less* auditable, against
  the checkability principle; our predicate result showed robustness comes from
  simple deletion-proof invariants (count, contiguity), not weights.
- **Per-domain MoE namespaces** are harmless and cheap (a `required` set can be
  scoped) but marginal — kept as an option, not a layer.
